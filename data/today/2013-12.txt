Lowering GST threshold would raise half as much as claimed: NAB
New figures from the NAB show that lowering the GST threshold, even to zero, would raise less than half of the $800 million claimed by retail lobby groups. The bank's figures don't include the cost of collecting the tax, but retailers say the figures are distorted by the inclusion of a mass of overseas digital downloads. In good news for the retail sector, ABS figures show Australians put 0.5 per cent more money through the nation's tills in October than the month before.

Scientists say DNA extracted from a 400,000-year-old bone completely changes what we know about human evolution. The femur bone was found in a cave in Spain.

This new genetic link has baffled experts from around the world, who say it's back to the drawing board to work out exactly how Europeans evolved.

Nelson Mandela dies 
In his own words, Nelson Mandela 'walked the long road to freedom'; now the journey is at an end. South Africa's first black president, anti-apartheid leader, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate has died. Nelson Mandela was aged 95.
Taking the reins of a troubled country
Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 in a small village on the Eastern Cape. One of 13 children from a family with royal links, many say he was born to lead. His path to the presidency is a story well told - a long and difficult one - and the South Africa he inherited as its leader was equally troubled.

But what of the South Africa he left? Emira Woods is a specialist in African affairs, and the co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington DC. She joins The World Today to discuss his legacy.

Personalised medicine could improve treatment outcomes
There's been a quiet revolution in medicine that could radically change the way patients are diagnosed and treated for some life-threatening diseases.

Dire outlook if Holden folds
